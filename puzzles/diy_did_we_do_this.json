To finish off the rest of the work (and save their relationship), they have just received quotes from various tradespeople. Can you match the correct contact person with their trade, and the amount they quoted?\nThe permissible items are: \nTrade: ['Carpenter', 'Floor Sander', 'Plumber', 'Electrician']\nQuote: ['$6,500', '$4,000', '$2,500', '$5,000']\nName: ['Trent', 'Andreas', 'Casey', 'Arthur']",
