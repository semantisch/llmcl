    "description": "Anya has made many attempts at beginning healthy habits this year, each falling by the wayside after a few weeks at most! She has just renewed her determination to be healthier by starting the practice of drinking daily smoothies each morning. Each smoothie has a green vegetable, a type of nut, and a type of fruit, among other ingredients. She began on Monday and is four days in. Can you determine which ingredients were combined together, and the day Anya drank that smoothie?\nThe permissible items are: \nFruit: ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Pear']\nVegetable: ['Collard Greens', 'Kale', 'Spinach', 'Lettuce']\nNut: ['Almonds', 'Pecans', 'Macadamias', 'Kale', 'Cashews']\nDay: ['Wednesday', 'Tuesday', 'Pecans']",
