    "description": "Last night Amanda hosted a jigsaw puzzle night among friends, with a little friendly competition. There were five jigsaw puzzle to complete, one per couple, with a race against the others to be the fastest to finish. Each pair was assigned a celebrity style couple nickname, a hybrid of their two names. From the clues given, can you determine the position each couple placed, how many pieces were in their puzzle, and what their puzzle picture was?\nThe permissible items are: \nCouple: ['Hark', 'Philody', 'Dannifer', 'Geranda', 'Benevieve']\nPuzzle Size: ['1200 pieces', '700 pieces', '800 pieces', '900 pieces', '1000 pieces']\nPicture: ['700 pieces', 'Moroccan Rooftops', 'Cottage Garden', 'Taj Mahal', 'African Safari', 'Tower Bridge']\nPosition: ['3rd', 'African Safari', '2nd', '4th']",
