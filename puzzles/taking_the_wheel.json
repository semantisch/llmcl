    "description": "Dianne, a driver's license examiner, has just assessed five anxious new drivers during their driving tests. While some successfully passed, others committed too many infractions and did not qualify for their licenses today. Each person was marked down for at least one error. Can you determine the first driving error each person made and the time their test commenced?\nThe permissible items are: \nName: ['Hailey', 'Erik', 'Marius', 'Larissa', 'Jacob']\nDriving Error: [\"Didn't Stop (Stop Sign)\", 'Exceeded Speed Limit', 'Failed To Indicate', 'Driving Too Slow', 'Distracted Driving']\nTime: ['10:45am', '9:15am', 'Failed To Indicate', '10:00am']",
