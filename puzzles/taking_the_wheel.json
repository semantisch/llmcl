While some successfully passed, others committed too many infractions and did not qualify for their licenses today. Each person was marked down for at least one error. Can you determine the first driving error each person made and the time their test commenced?\nThe permissible items are: \nName: ['Larissa', 'Jacob', 'Erik', 'Marius', 'Hailey']\nDriving Error: ['Failed To Indicate', 'Distracted Driving', \"Didn't Stop (Stop Sign)\", 'Exceeded Speed Limit', 'Driving Too Slow']\nTime: ['10:00am', '9:15am', '11:30am', '8:30am', '10:45am']",
