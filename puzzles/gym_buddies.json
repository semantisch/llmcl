    "description": "In an effort to encourage new members to keep up with their goals, the popular gym \"Witness Fitness\" has implemented an optional buddy system. Willing members are paired with a stranger with whom they can easily commute to the gym, and the two earn rewards for continuing to attend regularly! Five of the newest pairs plan to attend this morning's classes together, though a few are considering some excuses to sleep in instead! From the clues provided, can you determine which of the members are paired together, as well as the time and class they plan to attend?\nThe permissible items are: \nPerson 2: ['Kevin', 'Yolanda', 'Jermaine', 'Beth', 'Giselle']\nClass: ['Sculpt n Tone', 'Pilates', 'Power Yoga', 'Strength', 'Kickboxing']\nClass Time: ['6:30am', '7:00am', '6:00am', '7:30am', '8:00am']\nPerson 1: ['Heather', 'Tahlia', 'Quinton', 'Richie', 'Breanna']",
