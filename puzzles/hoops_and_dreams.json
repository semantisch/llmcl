    "description": "Cody is a junior basketball coach and has just attended a district tournament where four of the teams he coaches participated. They all had hopes of getting to the state championships, but only two teams won their first game. Can you match each team with the name of its captain and their score from their first game? Note: The teams did not play against each other, and score alone does not indicate whether a team won their match as the scores of the opposing teams are not mentioned.\nThe permissible items are: \nCaptain: ['Jericho', 'Nisay', 'Alby', 'Kyle']\nScore: ['49', '54', '46', '51']\nTeam: ['46', 'Downtown Dribblers', 'Basket Breakers']",
